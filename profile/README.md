# Solargene Mod Menu — A Constellation of Switches at Your Fingertips

In **Solargene**, the universe speaks softly.
Energy flows, colonies mature, and decisions echo across quiet systems. It is beautiful — and sometimes, beautifully slow.

The **Solargene Mod Menu** is a **real-time control interface** that slips gently into that silence, offering you a panel of elegant toggles to shape time, matter, and motion. Not a blunt rewrite of rules, but a starmap of possibilities — one click at a time.

This is for players who want to *explore systems*, not wait for them.

## 🌌 Overview — A Living Menu for a Living System

Unlike classic trainers with rigid hotkeys, the Solargene Mod Menu provides a **visual in-game panel**. Every feature is grouped, labeled, and adjustable on the fly, turning complex mechanics into something almost musical.

What defines this mod menu:

* Clean, collapsible UI 🪐
* Real-time value sliders
* Independent feature modules
* Zero file modification

You don’t leave the game to control it. You stay inside the orbit.
